--- abstract

A Content-Signature header field is defined for use in HTTP.  This header field
carries a signature of the payload body of a message.

# Introduction        {#problems}

The Content-Signature header field carries a signature of the payload body of an
HTTP message [RFC7230].  This allows a recipient to detect when content is
modified.

The exchange of high-value messages via intermediaries is often necessary in
HTTP for operational reasons.  While those intermediaries might be trusted with
the information that they forward, some clients or servers might desire greater
assurances about the integrity of the information they receive.

The Content-Signature header field does not protect header fields.  If integrity
is important, only the information in the message payload can be relied upon.

No key management mechanism is defined.  Other specifications are expected to
describe how recipients determine what credibility is attributed to any given
signature key.


## Terminology          {#Terminology}

RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the terms MUST, SHOULD, and MAY.

## Example

The following HTTP/1.1 response is signed.  Line wrapping is added to fit
formatting constraints.

~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 17 Jun 2015 17:14:17 GMT
Content-Length: 15
Encryption-Key: keyid=a;
    p256ecdsa=BDUJCg0PKtFrgI_lc5ar9qBm83cH_QJomSjXYUkIlswX
              KTdYLlJjFEWlIThQ0Y-TFZyBbUinNp-rou13Wve_Y_A
Content-Signature: keyid=a;
    p256ecdsa=Hil-_2xU6BjQcU6a8nhMCChLr-fkrek5tE6pokWlJb0
              HkQiryW045vVpljN_xBbF8sTrsWb9MiQLCdYlP1jZtA

Hello, World!
~~~

This places the signing key in the same message as the signature. This reduces
the value of the signature to that of a checksum; more value is realized when
the key is established over a separate channel, such as might happen with
[I-D.reschke-http-oob-encoding].

# The Content-Signature Header Field {#csig}

The Content-Signature header field uses the extended ABNF syntax defined in
Section 1.2 of [RFC7230] and the `parameter` rule from [RFC7231].

~~~
Content-Signature = 1#csig_params
csig_params = [ parameter *( ";" parameter ) ]
~~~

Each content signature is separated by a comma (,) and is compromised of zero or
more colon-separated parameters.

The message payload is prefixed with the UTF-8 encoded string
"Content-Signature:" and a single zero-valued octet before being passed to the
signature algorithm.  This discriminator string reduces the chances that a
signature is viable for reuse in other contexts.

The following parameters are defined:

keyid:

: This parameter identifies the key that was used to produce the signature.
  This could identify a key that is carried in the Encryption-Key header field.
  This parameter can always be provided together with other parameters.

p256ecdsa:

: This parameter contains an ECDSA [X.692] signature on the P-256 curve
  [FIPS186].  The signature is produced using the SHA-256 hash [FIPS180-2]. The
  resulting signature is encoded using URL-safe variant of base-64 [RFC4648]
  without padding. No parameters other than `keyid` can be specified along with
  the `p256ecdsa` parameter.

p384ecdsa:

: This parameter contains an ECDSA [X.692] signature on the P-384 curve
  [FIPS186].  The signature is produced using the SHA-384 hash [FIPS180-2].  The
  resulting signature is encoded using URL-safe variant of base-64 [RFC4648].
  No parameters other than `keyid` can be specified along with the `p384ecdsa`
  parameter.


Additional header field values can be defined and registered.  The parameter
MUST describe how the signature is produced and encoded.

Though the parameter defined in this document do not contain any optional or
parameterized features, new signature algorithms MAY use additional parameters
for conveying information about optional features.  The definition of new
parameters SHOULD describe what parameters can be combined with that parameter
and the resulting semantics.

The Content-Signature header field might be most efficiently produced as a
trailer field.  This allows for the production of the message body and the
signature in a single pass.


# Describing Signature Keys {#keys}

A message MAY include a public key.  This can be used to provision trusted keys.

Providing a signature public key is typically only useful where the provision of
the key can be attributed a higher level of trust than the signature.  A message
sent using out-of-band content-encoding {{I-D.reschke-http-oob-encoding}} is one
situation that benefits from the use of this header field.

Alternatively, explicitly including a public key can allow a verifier to
correctly identify the key that was used if the `keyid` parameter is not
sufficient.

This document defines two new parameters for use with the `Encryption-Key` header
field.  The `p256ecdsa` parameter conveys an uncompressed P-256 public key
[X.692] that is encoded using URL-safe variant of base-64 [RFC4648]. The `p384ecdsa`
parameter conveys an uncompressed P-384 public key [X.692] that is encoded using
URL-safe variant of base-64 [RFC4648].


# Security Considerations {#security}

Determining whether a signature is valid is only a small part of authenticating
a message. This document doesn't describe a complete solution for identifying
which signing keys are accepted.

This scheme does not authenticate header fields, or other request or response
metadata.  A recipient of a signed payload needs to be especially careful that
decisions that rely on authenticating the payload do not take any
unauthenticated material as input.  In particular, the request URI and the
`Content-Type` header field are not authenticated by this scheme.

No replay protection is offered for signatures.  This means that valid messages
can be captured and replayed.  Since there is no binding between the identity of
a resource and the signature, the content of a message can be replayed for a
request or response to a different resource; requests can be replayed as
responses; and messages can be replayed at different times.

Replay protection can be provided by including information in the message
payload itself that binds the content to a specific resource, time or any other
contextual information.  Since the signature binds messages to the signing key
pair, the potential for replay depends on the key being trusted outside of the
immediate context.  Narrowing the applicability of a given key can limit the
potential for replay.


# IANA Considerations {#iana}

## Content-Signature Header Field

This memo registers the `Content-Signature` HTTP header field in the Permanent
Message Header Registry, as detailed in {{csig}}.

* Field name: Content-Signature

* Status: Standard
* Reference: {{csig}} of this specification
* Notes:


## Content-Signature Parameter Registry

A registry is established for parameters used by the `Content-Signature` header
field under the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Parameters" grouping.  The
"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Encryption Parameters" operates under an
"Specification Required" policy [RFC5226].  The designated expert is advised to
consider the guidance in {{csig}} when reviewing new registrations.

* Parameter Name: The name of the parameter.
* Purpose: A brief description of the purpose of the parameter.
* Reference: A reference to a specification that defines the semantics of the parameter.

The initial contents of this registry are:

### keyid

* Parameter Name: keyid
* Purpose: Identify the key that is in use.
* Reference: {{csig}} of this document

### p256ecdsa

* Parameter Name: p256ecdsa
* Purpose: Conveys a signature using P-256, ECDSA and SHA-256 as described in
  {{csig}} of this document.

### p384ecdsa

* Parameter Name: p384ecdsa
* Purpose: Conveys a signature using P-384, ECDSA and SHA-384 as described in

## The p256ecdsa Parameter for the Encryption-Key Header Field

The `p256ecdsa` parameter is registered in the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) Encryption Parameters" registry established in
[I-D.thomson-http-encryption], with the following values:

* Parameter Name: p256ecdsa

  the `Content-Signature` header field.
* Reference: {{keys}} of this document

## The p384ecdsa Parameter for the Encryption-Key Header Field

The `p384ecdsa` parameter is registered in the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) Encryption Parameters" registry established in
[I-D.thomson-http-encryption], with the following values:

* Parameter Name: p384ecdsa
* Purpose: Conveys a signing key for use with the parameter of the same name on
  the `Content-Signature` header field.
